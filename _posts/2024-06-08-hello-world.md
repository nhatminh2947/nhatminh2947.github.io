# Gâ€™day, Iâ€™m Minh (or Ming, if thatâ€™s easier)! ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my blog! Iâ€™m a machine learning engineer with over five years of experience, currently working at Agoda. My journey in tech has taken me through a variety of projects, from building robust data pipelines to supporting the launch of new machine learning models in production.

For a long time, Iâ€™ve wanted to share what I learn along the way. Honestly, Iâ€™ve hesitated to start this blog because I was worried about criticism and feedback. But Iâ€™ve realised itâ€™s time to embrace that fear and just get started. After all, everyone has to begin somewhere. I also hope this blog can be a small part of the legacy I leave behind.

**What can you expect here?**  
Mostly tech topics such as machine learning, AI, large language models, and practical tutorials. Occasionally, Iâ€™ll share a bit about my personal journey and experiences in the field.

A fun fact about me: I love video games, but Iâ€™m not exactly a pro player. Thatâ€™s actually what inspired me to pursue a Masterâ€™s degree and learn how to teach machines to play games for me! ðŸ˜„

Thanks for stopping by. I hope you find something useful or interesting here, and I look forward to connecting with fellow learners and enthusiasts.
